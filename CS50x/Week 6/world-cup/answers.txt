Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I thought the time would scale exponentially, which is mostly true for larger values, but it is not true at the beginning their is basically no difference in time for 10,100 and 1000 runs.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
10000 as it seems like the best between cost effectiveness and giving a solid enough prediction
